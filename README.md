# Master's Thesis Code: Occupancy Level Estimation Using Environment Data

## Overview
This repository contains code for occupancy estimation used in the Master's thesis titled "Occupancy Level Estimation in an Indoor Environment for Building Automation."

## Purpose
The code implements various approaches for modeling occupancy levels based on environmental parameters collected from Dartford and Tampere meeting rooms.

## Dartford Meeting Room
- **Dart_Classification_Binary.ipynb:** Model classifying occupancy into occupied and unoccupied.
- **Dart_Classification_low_high.ipynb:** Model classifying occupancy into Unoccupied, Low, High.
- **Dart_regression.ipynb:** Regression-based modeling.
- **Dartford_Auto.ipynb:** Autoregression-based modeling with delayed lags of CO2 as features.

## Tampere Meeting Room
- **Tampere_auto_class.ipynb:** Autoregression-based modeling with subsequent classification into Unoccupied, Low, Medium, High classes.
- **Tampere_auto.ipynb:** Autoregression-based modeling with delayed lags of CO2 as features.
- **Tampere_Classification_Binary.ipynb:** Model classifying occupancy into occupied and unoccupied.
- **Tampere_Classification_low_medium_high.ipynb:** Model classifying occupancy into Unoccupied, Low, Medium, High.
- **Tampere_regression.ipynb:** Regression-based modeling.
